Got it — you want the business event YAML to stay clean (purely business-driven), and keep all the technical topic/Kafka/Flink configs in a separate configuration file.

That way:

Business analysts own the event contract YAML.

Engineers own the deployment/technical mapping YAML.

Both can evolve independently without breaking each other.

1️⃣ Business event definition YAML

(No Kafka or Flink details here — only the event name, meaning, and schema)

# business-events.yaml
version: "1.0"
namespace: "com.acme.events"
description: "Business-driven event catalog"

events:
  - name: OrderCreated
    version: 1
    description: "Triggered when a new order is created"
    payload:
      orderId: {type: string}
      customerId: {type: string}
      totalAmount: {type: decimal, precision: 12, scale: 2}
      currency: {type: string}
      createdAt: {type: timestamp, format: "iso8601", tz: "UTC"}
      items:
        type: array
        items:
          productId: {type: string}
          qty: {type: integer}
          price: {type: decimal, precision: 10, scale: 2}
    metadata:
      source: {type: string}
      traceId: {type: string, optional: true}
    event_time:
      path: "createdAt"
      watermark: {max_lateness: "5m"}

  - name: PaymentProcessed
    version: 1
    description: "Triggered when payment is successfully processed"
    payload:
      paymentId: {type: string}
      orderId: {type: string}
      amount: {type: decimal, precision: 12, scale: 2}
      method: {type: string}
      status: {type: string}
      processedAt: {type: timestamp, format: "iso8601", tz: "UTC"}
    metadata:
      source: {type: string}
    event_time:
      path: "processedAt"
      watermark: {max_lateness: "2m"}

2️⃣ Technical mapping & topic configuration YAML

(All Kafka & Flink details here — tied to event names)

# event-topics.yaml
globals:
  kafka:
    bootstrap_servers: "kafka01:9092,kafka02:9092"
    default_format: "json"
    default_scan_startup: "earliest-offset"
    schema_registry_url: "http://schemareg:8081"

mappings:
  - event: OrderCreated
    topic: "orders.created.v1"
    format: "json"
    key_fields: ["orderId"]
    flink:
      table_name: "orders"
      primary_key: ["orderId"]

  - event: PaymentProcessed
    topic: "payments.processed.v1"
    format: "avro-confluent"
    key_fields: ["paymentId"]
    flink:
      table_name: "payments"
      primary_key: ["paymentId"]

3️⃣ How Flink SQL generation works with two files

Step 1: Load business-events.yaml → read event structure (fields, types, event_time).

Step 2: Load event-topics.yaml → find mapping for each event.

Step 3: Merge → produce CREATE TABLE DDL.



---

Example generated Flink SQL (OrderCreated)

CREATE TABLE orders (
  orderId STRING,
  customerId STRING,
  totalAmount DECIMAL(12,2),
  currency STRING,
  items ARRAY<ROW<productId STRING, qty INT, price DECIMAL(10,2)>>,
  meta_source STRING,
  meta_traceId STRING,
  event_ts TIMESTAMP(3),
  WATERMARK FOR event_ts AS event_ts - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE,
  PRIMARY KEY (orderId) NOT ENFORCED
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'orders.created.v1',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'kafka01:9092,kafka02:9092',
  'properties.group.id' = 'flink-orders-consumer',
  'scan.startup.mode' = 'earliest-offset',
  'format' = 'json'
);

Advantages of separating files

✅ Business clarity – No tech noise in business events.
✅ Flexible mapping – Same event can be published to multiple topics or sinks.
✅ Environment-specific configs – Keep one business YAML, multiple env topic YAMLs (dev, staging, prod).
✅ Automation – Easy to script DDL generation by merging the two files.


---

If you want, I can make you a Python script that takes these two YAMLs and generates full Flink SQL DDLs automatically, so you never have to hand-write them.

Do you want me to prepare that generator?
