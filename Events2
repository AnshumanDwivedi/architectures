Got it — you want a business-driven event orchestration design where:

Event definitions are in YAML (business language, not low-level SQL).

Kafka topic definitions are in a separate config file (so event YAML stays clean).

Flink SQL does the heavy lifting (joins, filters, transformations).

The YAML is essentially an orchestration blueprint, which a loader converts into Flink SQL jobs.



---

1️⃣ Split the Configs

File 1 — topics.yaml (technical mapping only)

topics:
  customer_events:
    kafka_topic: customers
    schema: customer_schema.avsc
  order_events:
    kafka_topic: orders
    schema: order_schema.avsc
  payment_events:
    kafka_topic: payments
    schema: payment_schema.avsc

File 2 — events.yaml (business orchestration)

events:
  - name: CustomerOrderFlow
    description: Join customer and order to track order lifecycle
    sources:
      - ref: customer_events
      - ref: order_events
    transformations:
      join:
        type: inner
        left: customer_events
        right: order_events
        on: "customer_events.customer_id = order_events.customer_id"
      select:
        - "customer_events.customer_name"
        - "order_events.order_id"
        - "order_events.order_amount"
      filter:
        - condition: "order_events.order_amount > 500"

  - name: OrderPaymentFlow
    description: Match orders with payment confirmation
    sources:
      - ref: order_events
      - ref: payment_events
    transformations:
      join:
        type: left
        left: order_events
        right: payment_events
        on: "order_events.order_id = payment_events.order_id"
      select:
        - "order_events.order_id"
        - "order_events.order_amount"
        - "payment_events.status"

2️⃣ Mapping to Flink SQL

A small YAML → SQL mapper can generate Flink SQL:

Example for CustomerOrderFlow:

CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id STRING,
  customer_name STRING,
  WATERMARK FOR ts AS ts - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
) WITH ( 'connector' = 'kafka', 'topic' = 'customers', ... );

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id STRING,
  customer_id STRING,
  order_amount DOUBLE,
  ts TIMESTAMP(3),
  WATERMARK FOR ts AS ts - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
) WITH ( 'connector' = 'kafka', 'topic' = 'orders', ... );

INSERT INTO customer_order_flow
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_amount > 500;

3️⃣ Event Orchestration Logic

You can orchestrate:

Joins — inner, left, interval joins for time-based correlation.

Filters — business rules in YAML (converted to SQL WHERE).

Projections — list of fields in YAML (select → SELECT).

Aggregations — define in YAML (group_by, window).

Chaining flows — output of one event flow can feed the next (just refer to its output table).



---

4️⃣ Why This Works

Business-friendly — YAML describes intent, not SQL details.

Separation of concerns — topics are in one file, orchestration in another.

Composable — you can reuse flows, join outputs, change rules without touching SQL manually.

Deployable — mapper script can push final SQL into Flink SQL Gateway / Table API.



---

If you want, I can give you a full working example where:

1. These YAML files exist.


2. A Python or Java loader reads them.


3. Flink Table API job is generated automatically with joins and filters.



That would make orchestration actually runnable in Flink.
Do you want me to prepare that?
